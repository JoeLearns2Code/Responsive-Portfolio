                <p>I have worked 12 years in the eccomerce industry, and have recently decided to start on a new career
                    path
                    by enrolling in a coding bootcamp course. Previously, I attended the University of Washington and
                    graduated with distinction in two BA's. My proudest achievement in my professional career is
                    becoming a
                    manager for a small data entry & digital merchandising team.</p>
                <p>I enjoy reading, gaming, and taking long walks in the forest. I am a life long Star Wars and Tolkien
                    fan.
                    Above all I love learning and discovering new things.</p>
                <p>While I am primarily a cat person, I am fond of dogs too, and am pet friendly in general. I currently
                    do
                    not have any pets, but hope to adopt a couple kittens in July. I have a 4-year old niece and 2-year
                    old
                    nephew whom I love and adore.</p>
