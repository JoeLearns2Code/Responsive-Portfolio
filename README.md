# Responsive Portfolio Web Page

I have attempted to enhance my portfolio webpage with the addition of Media Queries.

## Getting Started

This project can be found in my github portfolio here: https://github.com/JoeLearns2Code/Responsive-Portfolio
The live page can be found here: https://joelearns2code.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio

### Prerequisites

You will need access to a common web browser to view the live page.  The data can also be pulled directly from GitHub via GitBash on PC or via Terminal on Mac.


### Installing

When you have accessed the repository page on GitHub, you may simply download a Zip file and extract it to a directory of your choosing.  Alternatively, you may download the data directly to your device via GitBash if you have an SSH key.  More on adding an SSH key can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

To download via GitBash, once you have a working SSH key with GitHub, create a folder you wish to download data into.  Next, click on the green 'Download or Clone' button on the GitHub respoitory page.  Make sure you have SSH key selected(and not HTTPS), and click on the clipboard icon.  This copies the address to your clipboard.

Next, navigate to the folder you wish to download the data into via GitBash or Terminal, and then simply type "git clone" followed by the link you copied onto your clipboard(paste via ctrl/cmd+v).  Press the enter key, and GitBash will pull the entire repository into your folder.


## Testing

HTML can be validated here: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input

Page scaling can be tested via Chrome using this extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-width/mlnegepkjlccabakompdmbcmdieaideh?hl=en-US

The goal of this project was to attempt to get the elements to scale properly in the following widths: 980px, 768px, 640px.  


## Built With
